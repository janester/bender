# 2 Person Settlers of Catan Rules

1. At the start of a turn, the player **rolls the dice twice** instead of once.  Resources are produced for both rolls.
2. If a 7 is rolled on the first roll, then **the player with fewer victory points controls the robber** (when victory points are tied, the player who rolled the dice controls the robber). If rolled on the second roll the person whole rolled the dice controls the robber.
3. The number of Victory Points for winning is increased from 10 to **12**.
4. The limit for the number of cards a player can hold when the robber is activated is increased from 7 to **9**.
5. After the setup phase, players collect resources for **both** initial settlements.
